Three peltier cooler elements were closely placed on the back of the finger of the polymer glove.  Three single DC brushed motor H-bridges drive each of the peltier elements.  Using custom code, we may drive current in either direction through the peltier elements.  When current through the peltier element is driven in one direction, the face of the peltier element that rests against the polymer glove will increase in temperature and the polymer glove becomes rubbery.  And vice-versa, for decreasing the temperature such that the polymer glove becomes glassy.

The experiment is set up utilizing the ATMEGA328p microcontroller.  The microcontroller has custom code to sense when the polymer glove flexes a finger to control a servo actuating a robotic finger.  The robotic finger has a force sensitive resistor (FSR) at its tip.  When the FSR makes contact with a surface, it triggers an event to actively cool the peltier elements.  When the operator flexes another finger, the robotic finger is relaxed, the FSR contact is released, and the robotic finger relaxes.  This event triggers the peltier elements to warm (slightly).
